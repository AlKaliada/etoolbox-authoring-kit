#### Debugging custom logic
You can debug the aem-authoring-toolkit's plugin while building your app. In order to do it run your build in debug mode e.g.:
```
mvnDebug clean install -PautoInstallPackage
```
Afterwards you can set breakpoints in your IDE, start a debugging session and connect to the build process. Default port is 8000.
